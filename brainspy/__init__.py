"""
A python package based on PyTorch and NumPy to support the study of different sorts 
of disordered nano-material networks for natural and energy-efficient analogue computing.
Particularly, it has been applied to the concept of dopant network processing units (DNPUs), 
a novel and promising CMOS-compatible nano-scale tunable material with potentially very 
low power consumption at inference stage. The framework is focused on two material-based 
approaches, for training DNPUs to compute supervised learning tasks: evolution in matter 
and digital twin models. While the evolution in matter focuses on providing a quicker 
exploration of newly manufactured single units of DNPUs, the digital twin approach is 
used for the design and simulation of the interconnection between DNPUs, enabling to 
explore its scalability.
